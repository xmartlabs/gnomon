# paxel-local

**YC's [Paxel](https://paxel.ycombinator.com/) tells you how you build with AI — by shipping
your coding-agent transcripts off your machine to do it.** Per YC's own description, it runs a
Docker container that mounts your home directory, **sends transcript excerpts — your prompts,
the agent's replies, tool-call snippets — to an LLM proxy**, and **uploads a JSON of scores,
narratives, and session metadata to YC**, readable by any YC employee and retained
indefinitely. The redaction strips credentials — *not* your source code, customer data,
secrets, or unreleased ideas.

**paxel-local gives you the same profile with zero data leaving your machine** — no upload, no
proxy, no account, no network calls at all. One command reads your local transcripts and writes
a branded, shareable builder profile:

![A paxel-local builder profile, generated 100% on-device](docs/example-poster.png)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Photobombastic/paxel-local
cd paxel-local && python3 paxel.py     # reads your local transcripts; opens your profile
```

Clone, run, done — your profile pops open in the browser: an archetype, a gstack-grounded
scorecard, your signature moves, and a one-click shareable poster like the one above. Nothing
leaves the laptop. *(That poster up top is my own real profile — generated locally, public
only because I chose to share it.)*

## Is this "exactly" Paxel?

No — and it can't be. **Paxel is closed-source** (a `curl | bash` → proprietary Docker image).
This is a *functional* recreation: it reproduces the metric set Paxel advertises (builder
archetype, autonomy score, planning ratio, code velocity, tool diversity, work-hour
distribution, error recovery, iteration depth, standout traits) using its own reasonable
formulas — Paxel's exact algorithm isn't published. Same *input* (your local transcripts),
same *experience*, not byte-for-byte parity.

## What you get

One command emits a complete, **branded, shareable `profile.html`** — open it in a browser and you get:

1. **An archetype** — the builder you are (Architect, Brute-Force Architect, Velocity Machine, Quality Guardian, The Director, …), named from your sessions.
2. **A 0–10 scorecard** across **three dimensions** (Execution, Planning, Engineering), each grounded in gstack (below) — plus a plain-language read on **how you steer agents** (long leash vs. short leash), which we *describe* instead of grade (here's why: [below](#how-scores-are-graded--grounded-in-gstack-not-an-arbitrary-scale)).
3. **Your signature moves** — the decision-patterns in how you direct the AI ("you review more than you write", "plan wide, then grind narrow"), drawn from real session behavior and tagged to the gstack stage each expresses.
4. **Your growth edge** — a few specific things to try next, keyed to your *own* weakest signals and the gstack skill that addresses each — not generic advice.
5. **A "what we noticed" card grid** + Share buttons (Post on X / Copy caption / Download a **branded poster image** — archetype, scorecard, headline numbers and your highlight cards in one PNG that works in every browser).

No manual step, no LLM call required. The archetype, scores, signature moves, and growth edges all
come from **transparent local rule engines** (`compute_scores` / `pick_archetype` / `signature_moves`
/ `growth_edges` in `paxel.py`) over the measured metrics — Paxel's real algorithm is closed, so this
is a reasoned estimate, not a replica. The counts are measured and reproducible; the verdicts are an
opinion, and the report says so. Nothing quotes your raw prompt text, so the profile stays shareable
without leaking session content.

Want a richer, prose narrative? `narrative_input.md` is also written — paste it into your own
Claude/GPT and it'll write you a deeper profile locally. That's optional; the HTML stands alone.

## How scores are graded — grounded in gstack, not an arbitrary scale

The three scored axes aren't a rubric we invented in a vacuum. Each one is **derived from
[Garry Tan's gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack)** — his open-source framework that turns
Claude Code into a virtual engineering team. gstack and YC's Paxel both come out of Garry-Tan-world,
so grounding the scores in gstack's *actual* definitions of good building is plausibly closer to
what Paxel itself grades against — and it's a more honest story than a number we made up.

We then **audited the rubric by running the real gstack skills on it** — `/plan-eng-review`,
`/plan-ceo-review`, and `/review`, dispatched as independent subagents so the tool's author wasn't
grading their own work. That audit hardened the design: **each metric is now owned by exactly one
axis** (so no two axes secretly move together), and a fifth "Product Instinct" axis — which Paxel has
— was **cut**, because the review showed it was mostly skill-detection plus terms recycled from other
axes. Coding transcripts don't honestly reveal product judgment, so we don't fake a score for it.
A later validity pass went one further and **demoted Steering from a scored axis to a described one**
(above): hands-on cadence is real and measurable, but it has no better-or-worse end, so grading it
only ever produced a backwards number. Three honest scores beat four where one points the wrong way.

gstack frames building as a sprint — **Think → Plan → Build → Review → Test → Ship → Reflect** — on
top of three ethos pillars: **Boil the Lake** (completeness is cheap with AI, so do the complete
thing), **Search Before Building** (know what exists before you build it), and **User Sovereignty**
(AI recommends, the human decides — and per Anthropic's own research that gstack cites, *experts
interrupt more, not less*). Each axis maps a slice of that framework onto the metrics paxel can
honestly measure from transcripts:

| Axis | What it measures | Grounded in |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution** | Shipped output at AI leverage — committed-code rate (coverage-corrected, ≤1.4×, disclosed in `report.md`), **fidelity** (how much of what you generate actually lands in git), and delegation/parallelism | gstack's **Build** phase + the "Golden Age" ethos (one builder shipping like a team) |
| **Planning** | Think-before-build — exploring before writing, reasoning depth, and plan/spec ceremony | gstack's **Think + Plan** phases + "Search Before Building" |
| **Engineering** | Craft & low rework — getting files right early, little file-thrash, low error rate, and review/test/investigate discipline | "**Boil the Lake**" + the **Review / Test / Reflect** stages |

**Steering is described, not scored.** Below the three bars you'll see a one-line read — *long
leash* (you point the agent and let it run) → *short leash* (you stay close and course-correct) —
with the raw cadence (actions per turn, how often the agent checked in). It maps to gstack's **User
Sovereignty** pillar, but we don't put a 0–10 on it: a deliberate hands-off operator who delegates
and gets clean autonomous output back is steering by a mechanism transcripts can't see (it needs
delegation→survived-to-commit attribution — on the roadmap), so any grade would just punish autonomy.

**Signature moves** (`signature_moves`) and the **growth edge** (`growth_edges`) are the same idea applied
to prose: named decision-patterns and next-steps, each gated on a real threshold (we never pad), tied to
a gstack stage, and keyed to *your* numbers. The growth edge points at the gstack skill that closes your
weakest gap — e.g. review ≫ test → `/qa`; file-hammering → `/investigate`; thin planning → `/autoplan`.

How the criteria were built: one subagent per axis read the real gstack role/skill definitions
(`office-hours`, `autoplan`, `plan-ceo-review`, `review`, `qa`, `investigate`, `ship`, `retro`, …)
and the ethos, derived that axis's notion of "good," then mapped it onto paxel's available metrics —
and a later round of gstack-skill audits hardened it (above). Every term is transparent, clamped 0–1
against a justified target, and weighted to sum to 1.0 — read `compute_scores` in `paxel.py`; nothing
is hidden. Honest limits we don't paper over: paxel can't see test *coverage* from transcripts —
it detects test **runs** (named test skills **and** shell runners like `pytest` / `go test` /
`npm test`), so if you test some other way it can't see, the growth edge says so rather than claiming
"0 tests"; the git-vs-tool fidelity signal is noisier when git only sees some of your repos; and
Engineering's iteration signals only see `Edit`/`Write` work, not files you rewrite purely through the
shell. Scores are an opinion; the counts underneath are fact.

## Sources

Auto-detected and parsed (all reads local):

| Tool | Location | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/projects` | full |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/sessions` | full |
| **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/tmp` | full |
| **Pi** | `~/.pi/agent/sessions` | full |
| **opencode** | `~/.local/share/opencode/storage` | full |
| Cursor | `…/Cursor/.../state.vscdb` | detected, experimental (SQLite blobs — not yet parsed) |

Non-Claude formats are translated into a common event shape so every metric works across
tools (Claude/Pi-specific signals like skills/subagents/thinking are naturally richer).

## Run it

```bash
python3 paxel.py            # all detected sources → writes profile.html (+ report.md, stats.json)
python3 paxel.py claude     # restrict to one (or several) sources, e.g. just Claude Code
```

It then **opens `profile.html` in your browser automatically** when it finishes (pass
`--no-open` to skip — useful on a headless box or in CI, where it just prints the path).
No dependencies beyond the Python 3 standard library. **No network calls anywhere.** For
accurate churn it shells out to the local `git` CLI (`git log --numstat`) on the repos found
in your transcripts — still 100% on-device, nothing uploaded.

## How churn is measured (and why it matters)

Most "how you build" profilers only see the assistant's `Edit`/`Write` tool calls. But a huge
amount of real work happens through the **shell** — `cat <<EOF > file` heredocs, `>`/`>>`
redirects, `sed -i`, scripts that generate files. That work is invisible to the tool-call
path, which makes shell-heavy ("brute-force") builders look artificially clean.

So this reports churn three ways, honestly:

1. **Git churn (gold standard)** — `git log --numstat` over your authored commits in the
   window, deduped by repo identity (root commit) so multiple clones aren't double-counted.
   Captures *every* committed change however it was made. **Caveat:** only covers repos still
   on disk — the report tells you the coverage (e.g. "4/13 repos"), because work done in
   directories that no longer exist can't be counted.
2. **Tool churn** — lines via `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`. What naive profilers show.
3. **Shell-authored estimate** — file-writing Bash calls + lines of heredoc/redirect content.

Iteration depth is reported as mean / median / p90 / **max** (a single mean hides the
"hammered one file 100+ times" tail), and errors as a rate, so brute-forcing reads as
brute-forcing.

## Outputs

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `report.md` | deterministic stats, human-readable |
| `stats.json` | all metrics, machine-readable |
| `narrative_input.md` | curated excerpts for the narrative pass — **stays local; may contain private content from your own prompts** |
| `profile.html` | **the deliverable** — branded, shareable builder profile (open in a browser) |

> **Note:** every output stays on your machine. Add them to `.gitignore` (this repo does) so
> you never accidentally commit your own data.

## Scope decisions

- **Multi-source** (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Pi, opencode), with per-source selection via args.
  Cursor is a SQLite blob store that still needs real reverse-engineering — detected and
  flagged, not faked.
- **One-shot.** Just re-run to rebuild as sessions accumulate.

## Notable implementation details (faithfulness)

- **Genuine prompts** exclude `isMeta`, `isCompactSummary`, tool-results, and `isSidechain`
  subagent-dispatch instructions — only human-typed turns count.
- **Active time** uses capped inter-event gaps (10-min cap), *not* raw session span, because
  `sessionId` is reused across resumed sessions spanning weeks (raw span over-inflates time).
- **Subagent work counts** toward tool/churn totals (it's work you delegated) but never toward
  your prompt count.
- Timestamps are converted UTC → local timezone for the work-hour histogram.
- The **archetype and 0–10 axis scores are interpretive** (Paxel's rubric is closed). The axes are
  derived from [Garry Tan's gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) (see "How scores are graded"
  above), but the *counts* are measured and reproducible; the scores are an opinion laid on top.

## Known limitations — PRs welcome 🐦

Honest about what it can't see. If you can close one of these, open a PR:

- **`sed -i` / runtime-generated files** — a command like `python build.py` writes files whose
  content never appears in the transcript, so the shell-authored estimate misses it. Git churn
  catches it *if* it was committed in a repo still on disk.
- **`~/.claude/history.jsonl`** (a separate flat prompt log) isn't parsed yet.
- **Cursor** (SQLite `state.vscdb` blobs) is detected but not yet parsed — reverse-engineering it
  into the common event shape is a great first PR.
- **Codex tool churn** from `apply_patch` counts raw patch lines (diff markers included), so it
  over-estimates; the gold-standard git churn is unaffected.
- **Score grounding** — axis *criteria* are derived from gstack, but the **archetype** picker
  (`pick_archetype`) is still a hand-rolled rule set, and the gstack→metric mappings are a first
  pass. Sharper targets, or mapping archetypes onto gstack's roles (CEO / Eng Manager / QA Lead / …),
  would be great contributions.
